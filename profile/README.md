## Our Projects

### Project Halo
Project Halo consists of two key device, Lumin, and Oxbit. Each device is designed to assist with a key aspect of the moviegoing experience.

#### Lumin
**Wearable glasses-based system for closed captions**

Lumin is an AR based closed captioning system. Captions appear directly in the viewer's field of visionâ€”discreet, dignified, and fully synchronized with the film. Built to replace outdated infrared solutions, Lumin works through modern docking and server management systems.

#### Oxbit
**Compact audio solution for personalized sound control**

Oxbit enables theatre guests to customize their audio experience with volume, filtering, and clarity adjustments without interfering with others' enjoyment. This compact solution addresses the diverse hearing needs of cinema audiences.
