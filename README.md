## 🚀 Our Projects

### 🎯 Project Halo
**Wearable glasses-based system for closed captions**

Halo is a revolutionary approach to cinema accessibility. Captions appear directly in the viewer's field of vision—discreet, dignified, and fully synchronized with the film. Built to replace outdated infrared solutions, Halo works through modern docking and server management systems.

### 🔊 Project Oxbit
**Compact audio solution for personalized sound control**

Oxbit enables theatre guests to customize their audio experience with volume, filtering, and clarity adjustments without interfering with others' enjoyment. This compact solution addresses the diverse hearing needs of cinema audiences.
